# HBR Article Downloader

This project aimed to download PDF articles from the Harvard Business Review (HBR) website.  Unfortunately, this project is a failure and was unable to successfully download articles.

## Reasons for Failure

The primary reason for the project's failure is due to HBR's website guidelines and robust firewall system.  HBR actively prevents automated scraping and downloading of their articles.  Their security measures effectively blocked the attempts made by this project to access and download the PDF files.

## Future Improvements (Highly Unlikely)

Overcoming HBR's security measures would require significant effort and potentially violate their terms of service.  Therefore, further development of this project to achieve its original goal is highly unlikely.
